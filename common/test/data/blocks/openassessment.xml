      Censorship in the Libraries

      'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any
      other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove
      that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly
      the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on
      the shelf for any of us.' --Katherine Paterson, Author

      Write a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting your views on censorship
      in libraries. Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music,
      movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are
      found offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your
      own experience, observations, and/or reading.

      Read for conciseness, clarity of thought, and form.
